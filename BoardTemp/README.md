# Diode-based Board Temperature

An easy and low-cost way to measure Centigrade temperature with a diode. This support library makes it easy.

## Define a board-temp sensor

Constructor:
```cpp
BoardTempDiode(int pin, int read_resolution, float temp_cal, float mV_cal)
```
* `pin` - the microcontroller pin that the voltage reading will be sampled from
* `read_resolution` - the number of bits of resolution that your microcontroller is sampling. 10 is the default on most Î¼Cs. The teensy 4.0 can go up to 12 (or so I've read). This parameter doesn't actually change the read resolution of your board. To do that, you must call `analogReadResolution(num_bits)`.
* `temp_cal` - the temperature (Centrigrade) reading at the time of calibration. This must be taken with an external temperature sensor that has already been calibrated (like an IR gun, or something).
* `mV_cal` - the milliVoltage reading at the time of calibration. The member function `.get_mV()` returns the last calculated mV, so it's easy to spit this out on a serial print statement during calibration. Just be sure that you are also calling the `.value()` member function, as the last milliVoltage is calculated only in that function call.

## Sample a sensor

You can sample the board temp diode with `.sample()`, and get the average value of the samples during the last sampling period with `.value()`. You'll probably want to sample the diode at a higher rate than you use the value, although this is temperature, so it shouldn't really change too fast.

## Update microcontroller voltage

By default, the temperature calculations are done off of a max reading of 3300mV. If you are using a 5V microcontroller, you will want to also update that voltage. You can do so by using `set_uC_mV()`. For example, if I were to use a 5V microcontroller with a sensor called `board_temp`, I'd call `board_temp.set_uC_mV(5000)`.

## Complete code example

```cpp
#include <BoardTemp.h>
#include <EasyTimer.h>

// parameters and calibrations
const int pin = 19;
const int read_resolution_bits = 12;
const float temp_cal = 26.2;
const float mV_cal = 580;

// define a BoardTempDiode object
BoardTempDiode board_temp(pin, read_resolution_bits, temp_cal, mV_cal)

// define an EasyTimer for sampling, and one for printing
EasyTimer sample_timer(100);  // 100Hz
EasyTimer print_timer(10);  // 10Hz


void setup(){

  Serial.begin(115200);

  // you must call this, otherwise your sensor calculations will not work
  board_temp.begin()

}


void loop(){

  if (sample_timer.isup())
    board_temp.sample();

  if (print_timer.isup())
    Serial.println( board_temp.value() );

  // To print out the millivoltage reading during calibration, you can call:
  // Serial.println( board_temp.get_mV() );
}
```
